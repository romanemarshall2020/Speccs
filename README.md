the purpose of my app is to show a list of past and current phones along with there images, dscriptions and current price.

completing this project was challenging mainly because i had learn how to utilise grid the best i could. i was able to make my prject look somewhat presentable this time around by learning how to place items and catogorizing them in specifics divs. by doing so i was able style and correctly use css grid to place items where i wanted them to be.

i made a nav a bar and learn a bit about utilizing color schems to make my project pop a bit more
